# Be as creative as possible in creating the story, locations, characters and themes. Everything that happens in the story should be original, clever, and logical, but also unpredicatable. Avoid using common fiction tropes and story lines. Create something more original and interesting than anything commonly used in fiction today. Use only fictional names, places and settings. Try to create characters that are complex, relatable, and believable.
